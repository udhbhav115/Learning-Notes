1.Beans is known as objects which are managed by spring IOC container.

2.IOC stands for Inversion Of Control and it is a process of defining the dependencies by without creating them

public class Company {
    private Address address;

    public Company(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    // getter, setter and other properties
}

public class Address {
    private String street;
    private int number;

    public Address(String street, int number) {
        this.street = street;
        this.number = number;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

Address address = new Address("High Street", 1000);
Company company = new Company(address);

This is the traditional method of creating objects it will lead to dependencies here we can see that Company class is dependent on Address class.

public class Config {
    @Bean
    public Address getAddress() {
        return new Address("High Street", 1000);
    }
}

If we define our dependencies with @Bean annotation then spring IOC container will create the dependency and inject the dependency
