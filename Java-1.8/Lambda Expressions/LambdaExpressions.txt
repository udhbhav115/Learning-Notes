-> What is lambda expression?
Lambda expression is a feature introduced in java 8 which helps to implement a one abstract method interface(functional interface) in a Consise way(easier way) rather that writing all the bolierplate code with the help of Function Interface.

Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface Test{
	void print(String string);
}

Test test=new Test() {
	@Override
	public void print(String string) {
		System.out.println("Hello "+string);
		}
}; // orginal implementation of interface without extends to any class

Test test2=i->System.out.println("Hello "+i); //Consise way to implement interface

In both cases we will get same output.

-> What is Function Interface?
It is an easier way to implement functional interface. the Function interface is also a functional interface

Syntax:Function<T,R> function; // <T> the type of the input to the function<R> the type of the result of the function

Example:Function<String, String> function=(i)->"Hello "+i;
		
		String apply = function.apply("Udhbhav");
		
		System.out.println(apply); // It will print Hello Udhbhav
		
-> An interface which contains only one abstract method and as many as default,static methods is called as functional interface
