-> In which package Stream Api is available?
java util.stream package

-> Can we able to reuse the stream?
No,we cannot able to reuse the stream if we have performed terminal operation on stream and try to reuse them again then IllegalStateExeception will be generated.

Example Program:
stream.filter(i->i>0).forEach(i->System.out.println(i));
System.out.println(stream.filter(i->i>0).count()); // In this case it will generate IllegalStateExeception

To avoide the IllegalStateExeception we need to use Supplier interface which contains get method it will help to give a new instance of the stream.

Example Program:

Supplier<IntStream> supplier=IntStream.of(12,23,34,86,-12,-11);
supplier.get().filter(i->i>0).forEach(i->System.out.println(i));
System.out.println(supplier.get().filter(i->i>0).count());

-> Why we cannot able to reuse the stream?
It is because we have applied the terminal operation on the stream so we have to create a new instance to reuse the stream.

Example Program:
stream.filter(i->i>0).count() // here stream has been ended by applying terminal operation(count function)

-> What is the use of Supplier interface?
Supplier interface was introduced since java 8 to implement the functional programming it will be useful when we don't want to supply anything and obtain a result at a same time in the form of T stands for class from the get method

internal Implementation
T get();
